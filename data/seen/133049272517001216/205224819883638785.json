I'm __**YouTube**__, a bot made by **@\u200bFrancis#6565**.\n\nI'm made in Python using the `discord.py` library, and I'm here to interact with **YouTube via Discord**, so you don't have to.\n\n__**What can I do?**__\n\n- I can search YouTube for a video.\n- I can search YouTube for a channel.\n- I *can* do other stuff... But it's in testing!\n\nFor more info, join the YouTube help server (https://discord.gg/yp8WpMh) and ask for @\u200bFrancis#6565.\n\nLike what I do? Donate here: https://paypal.me/MLAutomod/5",
