It's a security risk by not commiting the token data to a env var.\n\nOne Heroku user (jamfarts) wrote:  `i had to set it all up first locally so that I HAD the settings TO commit. Then I had to commit the settings. I cloned the repo and committed to my own, with the /data folder and all its contents. \nI can't rely on it for anything time related overnight. and any changes i need to do i have to pull it down, do them locally, commit it, and restart the bot. so if i want to add to the filter list, or custom commands, i have to do that, but i only did it because I could make the repo private`",
